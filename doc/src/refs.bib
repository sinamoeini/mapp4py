	abstract = {Molecular simulations, when they are used to understand properties characterizing the mechanical strength of solid materials, such as stress-strain relation or Born stability criterion, by using elastic constants, are sometimes seriously time consuming. In order to resolve this problem, we propose an efficient simulation approach under constant external stress and temperature, modifying Parrinello-Rahman (PR) method using useful sampling techniques developed recently-massive Nose-Hoover chain method and hybrid Monte Carlo method. Test calculations on the Ni crystal employing the embedded atom method have shown that our method greatly improved the efficiency in sampling the elastic properties compared with the conventional PR method.},

	abstract = {The interplay between diffusional and displacive atomic movements is a key to understanding deformation mechanisms and microstructure evolution in solids. The ability to handle the diffusional time scale and the structural complexity in these problems poses a general challenge to atomistic modeling. We present here an approach called diffusive molecular dynamics (DMD), which can capture the diffusional time scale while maintaining atomic resolution, by coarse-graining over atomic vibrations and evolving a smooth site-probability representation. The model is applied to nanoindentation and sintering, where intimate coupling between diffusional creep, displacive dislocation nucleation, and grain rotation are observed.},

	abstract = {Diffusive molecular dynamics is a novel model for materials incorporating atomistic resolution and reaching diffusive time scales. The main ideas of diffusive molecular dynamics are to first minimize an approximate variational Gaussian free energy of the system with respect to the mean atomic coordinates (averaging over many vibrational periods), and to then perform a diffusive step where atoms and vacancies (or two species in a binary alloy) flow on a diffusive time scale via a master equation.  We present a mathematical framework for studying this algorithm based on relative entropy, also known as the Kullback--Leibler divergence. This adds flexibility in how the algorithm is implemented and interpreted.  We then compare our formulation, relying on relative entropy and absolute continuity of measures, to existing formulations and find agreement.},
